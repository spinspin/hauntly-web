# Hauntly v1.2 Is Here

We've been listening to your feedback and working hard to make Hauntly even better. Version 1.2 brings several highly requested features and improvements.

## New Features

### Night Vision Camera Mode

Investigate in complete darkness with our new night vision camera mode. Using your phone's camera with enhanced low-light processing, you can now record video investigations even in pitch-black environments. The green-tinted night vision display gives you clear visibility while maintaining that authentic investigator feel.

### AI-Enhanced EVP Analysis

Our EVP recorder now features AI-powered voice detection. The system automatically identifies and highlights potential voice patterns in your recordings, making it easier to review hours of audio. Detected voices are marked with timestamps and confidence scores.

### Redesigned Dashboard

The investigation dashboard has been completely redesigned for faster access to your tools. Switch between detection modes with a single swipe, and view all your sensor readings in a unified real-time display.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where EMF readings could spike incorrectly near certain Bluetooth devices
- Improved battery optimization during long investigation sessions
- Resolved a crash that occurred when saving large audio recordings
- Enhanced location accuracy for investigation site mapping

## What's Next?

We're already working on v1.3, which will include collaborative investigation sessions, allowing multiple Hauntly users to share real-time data during group investigations. Stay tuned!

Update now on the App Store and Google Play.
