## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the EMF detector work?
Hauntly uses your phone's built-in magnetometer to measure electromagnetic field fluctuations. The app displays real-time readings and logs them to your ghost hunt timeline. Unusual spikes or patterns in EMF readings are commonly associated with paranormal activity.

### What is EVP and how does the recorder capture it?
EVP stands for Electronic Voice Phenomena — unexplained voices or sounds captured in audio recordings. Hauntly's EVP recorder uses your phone's microphone to capture audio during ghost hunts. Free users can record sessions up to 15 seconds, while Pro users get up to 15 minutes.

### What can I do with EVP recordings after capture?
Every recording is saved to your ghost hunt feed. With Hauntly Pro, you unlock the full EVP Analyzer — a suite of audio analysis tools including a frequency spectrum visualiser (FFT), spectrogram view, waveform with zoom and pan, 3-band parametric EQ, audio filters (voice enhance, noise reduction, bass/treble boost), reverse playback, A-B loop analysis, and markers to tag interesting moments.

### Does the app work without an internet connection?
Yes. All core features — EMF detection, EVP recording, photo capture, and the ghost hunt journal — work completely offline. Your data is stored locally on your device. You only need an internet connection for app updates or if you're on the free tier (for loading ads).

### What's the difference between Free and Pro?
Free gives you access to all core ghost hunting tools with some limitations. Pro unlocks extended recording (up to 15 minutes), all 8 background sounds, the full EVP Analyzer suite, PDF export, and removes all ads.

### Does the app drain my battery quickly?
Hauntly is optimised to be as battery-efficient as possible. During a typical ghost hunt, you can expect several hours of continuous use.

### Is my data private?
Yes. All your ghost hunt data — recordings, photos, notes, and sensor readings — stays on your device. We never upload your investigation data to our servers. The only third-party services we use are Google AdMob (ads for free users) and Sentry (crash reporting).
